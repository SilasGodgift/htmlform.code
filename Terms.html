</head>
<body>
    “Terms and Conditions” is the document governing the contractual relationship between the provider of a service and its user. On the web, this document is often also called “Terms of Service” (ToS), “Terms of Use”, EULA (“End-User License Agreement”), “General Conditions” or “Legal Notes”. <br>
    Terms of Service set the way in which your product, service or content may be used, in a legally binding way. They are crucial for protecting your content from a copyright perspective as well as for protecting you from potential liabilities. <br>
    Yes, it is not only advisable but also often mandatory.

Not only are terms critically important for protecting you from potential liabilities, but they regularly contain legally mandated information such as users’ rights, withdrawal or cancellation disclosures.

Generally, a website / app should have an accurate and valid Terms of Service document in place whenever complex issues are at stake, such as in the case of e-commerce, where sensitive information such as payment data is processed. <br>
Can I use a terms and conditions template?
Despite how simple they appear, terms and conditions are meant to meet incredibly complex and highly specific scenarios. Because each terms and conditions document is a legally binding contract that is meant to protect you, the business owner, it’s imperative that the document matches your specific business processes, model, and remains up-to-date with the various laws referenced in its contents. Templates simply cannot do this, therefore, we strongly suggest that you avoid using templates. Read our extended answer to this question here. <br>
